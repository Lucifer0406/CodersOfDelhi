## Hi there 👋

Developed a mini social network analysis system using pure Python, including 
data cleaning, 
mutual friend-based “People You May Know” recommendations, 
and collaborative filtering-based “Pages You Might Like” suggestions
without using external libraries like pandas or NumPy.

CODmain and CODmain2 files are my main codes...
Along side with "People you may know" page and "Pages you might like" page...
all the json files are only there to get data from for all the operations...

thanks for visiting my repo...
